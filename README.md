# Spotify API test  

## A NextJS experiment to fetch top 20 played tracks  

You will need to generate your own keys

I used Lee Robinson's guide on generating client IDs and tokens.  

- <https://leerob.io/blog/spotify-api-nextjs>
- Once you have the keys place them in a <em>.env.local</em> file in the route of the project
- e.g.   
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=  
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=  
SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN=  

### TODO  
- Allow user to dynamically choose between short, medium, and long term results
- Finish off the now playing function and display on screen.
